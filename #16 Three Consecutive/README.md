# Three Consecutive

Write a method **threeConsecutive()** that accepts three integers as parameters and returns 1 if they are three consecutive numbers ( i.e if the numbers can be arranged into an order such that their values differ by exactly 1 ) otherwise return 0.

For example, the call of ThreeConsecutive(3, 2, 4) would return 1.
