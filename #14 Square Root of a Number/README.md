# Square root of a number

Given a number n, devise an algorithm to compute its square root.

## Input

First-line will contain T=number of the test case, next T lines will contain an integer n where n >=1.

## Output

For each test case, calculate and print the square root of n with 2 decimal places in new lines.

### Sample Input

>```C
>6
>36
>16
>9
>20
>1
>11
>```

## Sample Output

>```C
>6.00
>4.00
>3.00
>4.47
>1.00
>3.32
>```
